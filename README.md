# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
**Duration:** June 2023 - July 2023  
**Type:** Self Project  
**Objective:** Developing a High-Accuracy Fraud Detection System with Advanced Classification Techniques

## Description
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced anomaly detection and classification techniques. The goal was to build a robust system capable of identifying fraudulent activities with high accuracy, ensuring a secure financial environment.

## Key Achievements
- **Fraud Detection Algorithms:** Implemented anomaly detection algorithms such as Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor to identify fraudulent transactions effectively.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to understand the patterns and characteristics of transactions. Applied Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address data imbalance issues.
- **Classification Algorithms:** Employed various classification algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Decision Tree to enhance the accuracy of fraud detection.
- **Performance Metrics:** Achieved a final ROC-AUC score of 0.99, demonstrating exceptional performance in identifying fraudulent transactions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes historical credit card transactions with labeled fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. The data was preprocessed to handle missing values and ensure quality.

## Installation
To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
